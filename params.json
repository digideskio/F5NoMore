{"name":"F5NoMore","tagline":"See every change as you make it.","body":"### Boost Your Productivity\r\nHow many times do you refresh your site in an hour of coding? 10? 20? 100? Every single change, every hour of every day you have to change windows and hit refresh to see the new result. That wastes your time and breaks your focus. Worse still since its annoying to refresh you sometimes skip looking at your most recent changes and let errors seep into your code longer making the eventual debugging process trickier.\r\n\r\nF5NoMore reloads the page whenever you save a change to your source files. With F5NoMore you can leave your project open in a second window  and immediately see the changes you made to the code reflected in the end product at every step in development. All without ever having hit a single key or context switch back and forth between windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting some\r\nFirst make sure you have Python (https://www.python.org/download/) and pip (http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) installed, then install the filesystem observer with:\r\n````\r\n  python -m pip install F5NoMore\"\r\n````\r\nAnd start the observer with:\r\n````\r\n  python -m f5nomore\"\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow add the F5NoMore extension from the Google Chrome webstore and you're good to go:\r\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/f5nomore/bgkkcdjaonlbjoopncdpdgchdohaieap\r\n\r\nTo select the files you want to watch for a project double click on the F5 logo. Once you're happy with the files you've selected you can close the window. Single click the logo to toggle F5NoMore on and off for each tab.\r\n\r\n### The future\r\nF5NoMore is something I put together to save myself some time. I'm releasing it in the hopes that it can help a some other people so I' puttting it under the MIT license - feel free to do whatever you want with it. If people turn out to like it there are a couple of additions I'd love to pursue. For example the ability to hotswap CSS without reloading the page.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I'd be interested in is making it so F5NoMore can be configured to launch the observer when your computer starts. Personally I run windows 7 and have a batch file in my startup directory that runs:\r\n````\r\n  start pythonw -m f5nomore\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf someone who is familiar with linux and Mac OS wants to talk to me about how best to set that up on other systems I'd be really grateful.","google":"UA-53575903-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
